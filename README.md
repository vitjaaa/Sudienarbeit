#Study Project

# This is only a Demo Version

This project was created by Viktor Tissen as part of a study project at the University of the Federal Armed Forces Munich.

The aim of this project is to improve weather forecasting at specific locations. To achieve this, weather data was collected using cup anemometers installed at two locations at the university. By utilizing the collected data along with weather forecasts, a forecasting model was trained to better compensate for location deviations.
